**Adding Security to Azure Resources with Terraform and Azure Pipelines**
This project contains Terraform configuration files and an Azure Pipeline YAML file to provision, manage, and secure Azure resources.

**Terraform Configuration (main.tf)**
The Terraform configuration provisions the following Azure resources:

    An Azure Resource Group
    A Virtual Network within the Resource Group
    Multiple Subnets within the Virtual Network
    A Public IP address
    An Azure Bastion Host with the Public IP address
    The configuration uses the Azure provider for Terraform. It also uses the AzureRM backend for storing the Terraform state.

**Azure Pipeline (azure-pipeline.yaml)**
The Azure Pipeline YAML file defines a multi-stage pipeline for validating, deploying, and securing the Azure resources defined in the Terraform configuration.

The pipeline includes the following stages:

    tfvalidate: This stage validates the Terraform configuration using the terraform validate command.
    tfdeploy: This stage deploys the Azure resources using the terraform apply command. It only runs if the tfvalidate stage succeeds.
    Security: This stage runs Microsoft Defender for Cloud to provide security for the deployed Azure resources. It depends on the tfdeploy stage.
    The pipeline uses the TerraformInstaller task to install the latest version of Terraform, and the TerraformTaskv3 task to run Terraform commands. It also uses the MicrosoftSecurityDevOps task to run Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

The pipeline does not trigger automatically when changes are pushed to the main branch (trigger: none). You need to run it manually.

**Usage**
To use this project, you need to provide values for the variables defined in the Terraform configuration and the Azure Pipeline. You can provide these values through a terraform.tfvars file or environment variables for Terraform, and through a variables block or pipeline variables for the Azure Pipeline.

Please review the Terraform documentation and Azure Pipelines documentation for more information on how to use Terraform and Azure Pipelines.

**Note**
Always review the Terraform configurations and Azure Pipelines before running them, especially when they affect real resources in an Azure subscription. Ensure it does comply with yor organization’s policies and guidelines. If you’re unsure, consult with RBA Platform engineering DevOps Team.
